## Chapter 2

- [Ex_1](./Ex_1.c)
    > Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to print your first and last names on one line.
- [Ex_2](./Ex_2.c)
    > Write a program to print your name and address.
- [Ex_3](./Ex_3.c)
    > Write a program that converts your age in years to days and diplays both values. At this point, don't worry about fractional years and leap years.
- [Ex_4](./Ex_4.c)
    > Write a program that produces the following output:
    ```
        For he's a jolly good fellow!
        For he's a jolly good fellow!
        For he's a jolly good fellow!
        Which nobody can deny!
    ``` 
    > Have the program use two user-defined functionsin addition to main(): one names jolly() that prints the "jolly good" message once, and one named deny() that prints the final line once.
- [Ex_5](./Ex_5.c)
    > Write a program that produces the following output:
    ```
        Brazil, Russia, India, China
        India, China,
        Brazil, Russia
    ```
    > Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one named br() that prints "Brazil, Russia" once, and one named ic() thatprints "India, China" once. Let main() take care of any additional printing tasks.
- [Ex_6](./Ex_6.c)
    > Write a program that creates an integer variable called toes. Have the program set toes to 10. Also have the program calculate what twice toes is an what toes squared is. Tha program should print all three values, identifying them.
- [Ex_7](./Ex_7.c)
    > Write a program that produces the following output:
    ```
        Smile!Smile!Smile!
        Smile!Smile!
        Smile!
    ```
    > Have the program define a function that displays the string Smile! once, and have the program use the function as often as needed.
- [Ex_8](./Ex_8.c)
    > Write a program that calls a function named one_three(). This function should display the word one on one line, call a second function named two(), and then display the word three on one line. The function two() should display the word two on one line. The main() function should display the phrase starting now: before calling one_three() and display done! after calling it. Thus, the output should look like the following:
    ```
        starting now:
        one
        two
        three
        done!
    ```
