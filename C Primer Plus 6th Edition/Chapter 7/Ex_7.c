/*
    Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
        the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
    a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
    b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
    c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
    20% of the next $150
    25% of the rest
        Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
        tax law.
