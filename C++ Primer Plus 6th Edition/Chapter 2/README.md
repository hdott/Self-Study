## Chapter 2

- [Ex_1](./Ex_1.cpp)
    > Write a program that displays your name and address.
- [Ex_2](./Ex_2.cpp)
    > Write a program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards.
    ```
        1 furlong = 220 yards
    ```
- [Ex_3](./Ex_3.cpp)
    > Write a program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main()) and produces the following output:
    ```
        Three blind mice
        Three blind mice
        See how they run
        See how they run
    ```
    > One function, called two times, should produce the first two lines, and the remaining function, also called twice, should produce the remaining output.
- [Ex_4](./Ex_4.cpp)
    > Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her age. The program should display the age in months.
- [Ex_5](./Ex_5.cpp)
    > Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value.
    ```
        Fahrenheit = 1.8 x degrees Celsius + 32.0
    ```
- [Ex_6](./Ex_6.cpp)
    > Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a distance in light years as an argumentand then returns the distance in astronomical units. 
    ```
        1 light year - 63240 astronomical units
    ```
- [Ex_7](./Ex_7.cpp)
    > Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute value. The main() function should then pass these two values to a type void function that displays the two values in the format shown in the format shown in the following sample run:
    ```
        Enter the number of hours: 9
        Enter the numbers of minutes: 28
        Time: 9:28
    ```
