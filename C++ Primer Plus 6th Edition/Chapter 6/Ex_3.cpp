/*
    Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display a menu
        offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user responds with a letter
        other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to
        enter a valid response until the user complies.Then the program should use a
        switch to select a simple action based on the userâ€™s selection.A program run could
        look something like this:
    Please eneter one of the following choices:
    c) carnivore        p) pianist
    t) tree             g) game
    f
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
    A maple is a tree;
